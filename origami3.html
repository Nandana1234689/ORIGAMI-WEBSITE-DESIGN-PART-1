<p> <h3> • Get a skin colored origami paper. Fold it in half and then unfold it. Fold it in other half and then unfold it. <br>
    • Turn the paper completely and then fold the paper diagonally.<br>
    • Now flip the paper again, on crease marks, fold it in order to create square.<br>
    • Once the square is formed,  fold back the two top sides.<br>
    • Then fold the back sides. You got yourself a mermaid face.<br>
